# Cluster based vein pattern
In the current study, we investigate the feasibility of mining and extracting unique, unsupervised cluster-based vascular patterns from vein photos. The proposed system must adhere to the vascular mapping into clusters in order to uncover the patterns linked to the 2D image data-driven templates. To fulfil this criterion, a learning mechanism appropriate for unlabeled data is created. To do this, pictures from four publicly accessible standard databases are used. With the development of pertinent quality evaluation, it has been demonstrated that a cluster-based approach combining machine learning multiscale filtering, feature extraction, feature recognition, identification, and matching can achieve 96.7% accuracy. This is more accurate than any other unsupervised vascular categorization algorithm that has been documented in the literature.
