# Cluster based vein pattern
Vein patterns are the least susceptible to a deception among the various identity verification system applications. The current work examines the viability of extracting vascular information from vein images and proposes a novel unsupervised cluster-based vascular pattern mining and extraction method. The suggested system must adhere to the vascular mapping into clusters to mine out the patterns associated with the 2D image data-driven templates. Thus, a learning mechanism suitable for unlabeled data is developed to meet this requirement. Images from four publicly available standard databases are employed to achieve this objective. A cluster-based technique comprising machine learning multiscale filtering, feature extraction, feature recognition, identification, and matching has been shown to attain 96.7% accuracy with the development of relevant quality evaluation. This is higher than the stated accuracy for most other unsupervised vascular classification methods in the literature.
